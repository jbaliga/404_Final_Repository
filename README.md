# 404_Final_Repository
Required Final Repository after 404 Demonstration



A FEW NOTES ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY:
First and most importantly: Any C# file, any file underneath the Unity_Subsystem_Written_Files, or any file underneath Data_streaming_files will ONLY run properly if the unity environment is already running. (Unity environment runtime is a prerequisite to these files functioning).

Second, all of the data conversion and tracking functionality requires a Raspberry Pi, as the modules are defined for Raspbian OS. The calibrations are the .jpg files named after their respective polygon.

Finally, All asset files were used in Unity environment, if you wanted to test these personally just create a new unity project in unity editor and move the assets here into the asset folder.
