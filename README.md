# 404_Final_Repository
Required Final Repository after 404 Demonstration



A FEW NOTES ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY:
First and most importantly: Any C# file, any file underneath the Unity_Subsystem_Written_Files, or any file underneath Data_streaming_files will ONLY run properly if the unity environment is already running. (Unity environment runtime is a prerequisite to these files functioning).

Second, all of the data conversion and tracking functionality requires a Raspberry Pi, as the modules are defined for Raspbian OS.
